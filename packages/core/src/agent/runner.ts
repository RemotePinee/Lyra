/**
 * Which loop drives a turn.
 *
 * The built-in one asks the model, runs whatever tools it asked for, and asks again until it stops
 * asking. That is one strategy among several — plan-then-execute, a loop that votes across several
 * replies, one that stops to check with a person on every write — and which is right depends on
 * what the agent is for, not on what this file happens to contain.
 *
 * Bound by the host at boot like the other seams, with the built-in loop as the fallback so the
 * CLI and the tests keep working without a kernel.
