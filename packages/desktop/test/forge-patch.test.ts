/**
 * Rebuilding a unified diff from a host's per-file change list.
 *
 * GitLab and Gitee return fragments with no `diff --git`, no `---`/`+++`, and — for a rename with
 * no edits — no content at all. The whole point of reassembling them is that the app keeps one
 * diff parser and one diff viewer, so what this suite actually asserts is that the output goes
 * back through `parseUnifiedDiff` and comes out as the same shapes GitHub's own patch produces.
