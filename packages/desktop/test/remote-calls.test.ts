/**
 * The table that lets a running fetch be stopped.
 *
 * Small, and worth its own tests because every one of its failures is silent. A token left behind
 * makes the *next* press do nothing, forever, with no error anywhere; a missing guard lets two
 * pushes race for the same repository; and cancelling has to stay distinguishable from failing, or
 * a red bar appears for something the user just did on purpose.
