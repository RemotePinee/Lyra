/**
 * Which situation a checkout is in, decided on plain data.
 *
 * The bug this exists to prevent: `git status` only reports `ahead` when the branch has an upstream,
 * so a branch that has never been pushed answered `ahead: 0` and the panel said 「已同步」 about a
 * repository whose every commit was still local. That is not a rendering mistake — it is the panel
 * asking a question that only has an answer in one of the seven cases it can be in.
 *
 * The order of the tests below is the order of the checks, because for two pairs the order *is* the
 * rule: a rebase detaches HEAD, and a fresh repository has both a branch and possibly a remote.
