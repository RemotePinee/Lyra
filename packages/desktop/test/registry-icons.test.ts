/**
 * Throwing away the logos that identify nothing.
 *
 * The case this was written for is on screen right now in the default catalogue: its entries carry
 * a `logo` URL each, and for everything that shipped no icon of its own the registry answers with
 * the GitHub avatar of whoever owns the repository it was built from. Since the official MCP
 * servers all live in one monorepo, seven different products came back wearing the same person's
 * face — a page of cards showing one photograph seven times, in the place the eye goes first.
 *
 * The rule is the definition of a mark read literally: a picture two entries share is not either
 * entry's mark. Nothing here knows about GitHub or avatars, which is deliberate — the same rule
 * catches a registry that hands out one placeholder to everything, and leaves alone a registry that
 * gives every entry its own icon.
