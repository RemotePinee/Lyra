/**
 * Reading many blobs out of a repository in one go.
 *
 * `git show HEAD:path` is the obvious way to read one, and it was how every diff in this app read
 * every file: one process per side per file. Measured on a repository with 120 modified files, at
 * eight concurrent, that is 418ms of pure process startup. The same 120 blobs through one
 * `cat-file --batch` take 29ms — fourteen times faster, and the difference is not the reading, it
 * is the two hundred processes that no longer exist.
 *
 * Two passes, because the contents have to be bounded before they are held. `--batch-check` prints
 * only the header, so it says how big each blob is for almost nothing; anything over the cap is
 * then never read at all. Without that, a repository with a few large generated files would pull
 * all of them into memory and then throw them away for being too large to diff.
