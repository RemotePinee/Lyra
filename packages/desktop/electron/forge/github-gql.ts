/**
 * The two GraphQL questions this app asks GitHub, and what the answers mean.
 *
 * GraphQL rather than REST for both, and for the same reason each time: the detail pane wants
 * eight things about one pull request — description, comments, reviews, requested reviewers, CI,
 * commits, labels, mergeability — and REST answers each of those from a different endpoint. That
 * was seven round trips per row you clicked, against a hosted API with an hourly budget. This is
 * one, and it costs a single point of five thousand.
 *
 * The search half lives in `pr-summary.ts` next door, which predates this file and has the tests.

/**
 * Everything the detail pane draws, for one pull request.
 *
 * `commits` appears twice under two aliases because two different questions need it: the last one
 * carries CI's verdict, and the first hundred are the timeline. Asking for a hundred and reading
 * the rollup off the end would work and would also transfer a hundred check rollups to use one.
 *
 * `reviewRequests` is spelled out as a union because `RequestedReviewer` is one:
 * `Bot | EnterpriseTeam | Mannequin | Team | User`. Three of them carry `login` and one carries
 * `name`; a member left unhandled comes back as an empty object, and the reviewer list quietly
 * grows a blank row. Bots are not the exotic case here — a repository with a review bot has one on
 * every pull request.
