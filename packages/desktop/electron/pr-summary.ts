 * ordinary hourly budget. Three buckets meant three of those thirty spent on every refresh, so a
 * few visits to this screen in quick succession — open it, refresh, come back — ran the list into
 * "API rate limit exceeded" while nothing else on the machine was anywhere near a limit.
 *
 * GraphQL charges against the hourly budget instead (5,000 points an hour; measured, this query
 * costs **1**), and aliases let all three searches travel in a single request. That headroom is
 * what makes the list able to refresh itself on a timer at all.
 *
 * Every field a row draws is asked for here, on purpose. The line counts, the branch, the author's
 * picture and CI's verdict used to arrive only with the detail — so a list showed none of them
 * until you clicked, and filling them in beforehand would have meant one `gh pr view` per row,
 * thirty processes and thirty round trips to decorate rows nobody opened. In a search they are
 * fields on a node that is already being returned, and they cost nothing extra to ask for.
